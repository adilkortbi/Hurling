    <h3> The Clash of Ash Your Monthly Hurling Fix | May 2025 Edition</h3>
    <h4>Hello hurling fans!</h4>
    <p>Welcome to the May edition of The Clash of Ash,
        your go-to newsletter for all things hurling -
        from match highlights to grassroots stories,
        player features, and upcoming fixtures. Here's
        what's making waves in the world of hurling this month:</p>
        <p>Match of the Month: Kilkenny vs Limerick - A Classic in the Making
            The All-Ireland contenders met again last weekend in what’s
            already being called one of the most intense matches of the year.
            Kilkenny edged out Limerick by a single point in a thrilling 2-21
            to 2-20 win at Semple Stadium. With both teams now firmly in
            the running for the championship, the rivalry is heating up like never before.</p>
            <p>Rising Star: Keep an Eye on Shane O’Sullivan
                At just 20 years old, Shane O’Sullivan of Waterford is turning heads with his speed,
                control, and pinpoint accuracy. After scoring 1-5 in his last two games,
                the young centre-forward is quickly becoming a fan favourite and a serious threat on the pitch.</p>
                <p>Club Scene Spotlight: Ballygunner’s Historic Run
                    Ballygunner continues their dominance in the club championship,
                    now unbeaten in 14 games across all competitions.
                    With their sights set on another Munster title,
                    the club’s mix of youth and experience is a model for others to follow.</p>
