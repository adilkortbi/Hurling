                <p>Hurling is an ancient Irish field sport played with a wooden stick called a hurley and a small leather ball known as a sliotar.
                    The game is played by two teams of fifteen players each, including a goalkeeper. The objective is to score by striking the sliotar
                    into the opponent's goal or over the crossbar between two upright posts. A goal, scored by sending the sliotar under the crossbar and into the net,
                    is worth three points. A point, scored by sending the sliotar over the crossbar, is worth one point.
                </p>
                <p>The game is played on a large rectangular grass pitch that resembles a rugby or soccer field in size, measuring roughly 130 to 145 meters long and 80 to 90 meters wide.
                    Each end of the field has H-shaped goalposts with a net under the crossbar to catch goals. The match begins with a throw-in at the center of the field by the referee.
                    Play restarts after a score or wide shot with a puck-out from the goalkeeper.</p>
                    <p>Players can strike the sliotar on the ground or in the air using the hurley, carry it on the hurley while running, or pass it by hand using an open-handed slap. 
                        They may also kick the ball. However, they cannot throw the sliotar or carry it in the hand for more than four steps without playing it. After four steps, a player must either bounce it on the hurley, strike it, or pass it.
                        Only one bounce on the hurley is allowed before the player must do something else with the ball.</p>
                        <p>The game is physical but regulated. Fouls include striking an opponent dangerously with the hurley, pushing, tripping, or picking 
                            the ball directly off the ground with the hand. Instead, players must use the hurley to flick the ball up. When fouls occur, the opposing team is awarded a free puck, which is similar to a free kick in soccer. If the ball goes out over the sideline, the opposing team gets a sideline cut, where the ball is struck from the ground along the sideline.
                            If defenders are the last to touch the ball before it crosses the end line without a score, the attacking team gets a 65-meter free puck.</p>
                            <p>Games typically last seventy minutes for senior inter-county matches, divided into two thirty-five-minute halves. Club and youth matches are often sixty minutes long,
                                with thirty-minute halves. There is usually a ten- to fifteen-minute break at halftime.</p>
                                <p>Players wear helmets with faceguards, which are mandatory, and may also wear mouthguards, gloves, or shin guards. The hurley varies in size depending on the playerâ€™s preference,
                                    generally between seventy and one hundred centimeters long.
                                    The sliotar is about the size of a tennis ball but made of leather and much harder</p>
                                    <p>The sport is governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), which organizes the main competitions, including the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship,
                                        the National Hurling League, and provincial championships in Leinster and Munster.
                                        There are also club-level championships and youth competitions.</p>
